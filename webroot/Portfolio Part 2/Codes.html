    Over the years, for one reason or another, I have had to learn multiple programming languages. 
    I have then used those in multiple different situations.

        <b>Python:</b>This was the first language that I ever learned and to this day it is the one I am most confident in.
        In high school, I was helping my Computer Science Teacher regularly in his classes. 
        I would go in my free time and teach the younger students he was giving classes to, Python.
        That was a very enriching and satisfying experience. 
        I am proud to say all the kids had fun and they learned a lot.

        <b>Processing:</b>Due to my University Education, which is highly artistic, I had to learn Processing and write a code, presenting data visulalisation in a very engaging way. 
        The project took me long and it eneded up being over 600 lines, but it was definitely worth it.

        <b>Java:</b>After learning Processing(a sub language based on Java), I had to learn Java. 
        I enjoyed that Process immensely. 
        Ever since then, I have been teaching Java to younger students online, due to Covid.
        I am motivated and organized, so I enjoy teaching other students how to think like a programmer.

        <b>HTML,CSS and JavaScript:</b>In the past I have worked on a couple of projects involving JavaScript, but I never really leaned into it, 
        so I am very glad that now I am having the chance to learn not only JavaScript, but HTML and CSS for two of my first year modules. 
        I look forward to be able to work with them!
