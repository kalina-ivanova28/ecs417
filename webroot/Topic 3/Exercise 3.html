    I am currently living in Puerto de la Cruz. 
    It is a small city located on Tenerife, which is one of the Canary Islands.
    The islands are a part of Spain.
  </p1>
  <br></br>
  <p1>
    Although this is the smallest municipality in Tenerife, covering just 8.7 km2 (3.36 sq miles), Puerto de la Cruz has plenty of appeal with its protected historic quarter and its seemingly endless coast, which is perfect for long, leisurely walks.
     Puerto de la Cruz spans the coastal part of the Valley of La Orotava in a stunning setting, with the mighty silhouette of Mount Teide rising 3,718 m (12,198 ft) high in the background. 
     Its wonderful climate made this the first tourist destination in the Canary Islands, ever since the British Medical Society recommended it in the 19th century as an ideal retreat. 
     The temperature here ranges from 15 to 22 ºC (59 to 72 ºF), meaning the sea, the fresh air and the relaxed atmosphere can be enjoyed all year round.

    Puerto de la Cruz has been considered a National Tourist Interest Site since 1955 because of its tradition as a centre for rest and recuperation and as a holiday destination. 
    Its fascinating and beautifully kept historic quarter, with over 140 protected buildings, is a pleasure for everyone who strolls through it – tourists and locals – at any time of year. 
    Puerto de la Cruz has the most restaurants and shops on the Island, so there are endless options for eating out and indulging in a bit of retail therapy. 
    A visit to the traditional fishing district of La Ranilla is particularly recommendable. 
    Since 2014, La Ranilla hosts the Puerto Street Art exhibition, an open air museum where 13 internationally acclaimed artists have made their mark covering large walls with art.

  <h2>Some of the main attractions include:</h2>
  <h3>Loro Parque</h3>
  <p2>
    Loro Parque has been named the Best Zoo in the world by TripAdvisor based on the experience of its visitors. 
    It is a magical place which offers a home to over ten thousand exotic and endangered animals, representing over five hundred species and subspecies from all over the Planet. 
    Its impressive facilities, a perfect recreation of their natural habitats, and over a million satisfied visitors every year, make Loro Parque the "must" of the Canary Islands.

  <br></br>
  <h3>Jardin Botanico</h3>
  <p2>
    La Orotava Acclimatisation Gardens was created by Royal Order of Carlos III on the 17th of August, 1788, due to the need to cultivate species from the tropics somewhere in Spain with a suitable climate. 
    The intervention of Alonso de Nava y Grimón, VI Marquis de Villanueva del Prado was essential both in the decision making and also to establish and develop the gardens in the early stages. 
    In 1790, the plans and memo were drawn up and work starts on the plans drawn by Nicolás Eduardo, architect from La Laguna. 
    In 1792, 35 new plantations are started.
  </p2>
  <br></br>
  <h3>Playa Jardin</h3>
  <p2>
    The Playa Jardín Beach Complex, which consists of Playa Jardín, Playa Chica and Punta Brava, is one of Puerto de la Cruz’s most emblematic attractions. 
        Designed by the artist César Manrique, these beaches meld seamlessly into a beautiful environment filled with gardens boasting lush local plant life, waterfalls, and rocky caves.
