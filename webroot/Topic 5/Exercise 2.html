        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            Todor Minkov School
            <br/>
            2009 â€“ 2014
            <br/>
            I have completed my first 5 years of education in this public school in Bulgaria before moving to Spain. 
            <br/>
            British School of Tenerife
            <br/>
            2014 - 2020
            <br/>
            I completed my IGCSEs and A-Levels in Spain. I completed 8 IGCSEs including Mathematics, Science, English Language, English Literature, German, Geography, Spanish and Business. On my A-Levels I obtained A*AA in Computer Science, Mathematics and German respectively. 
            <br/>
            Cambridge Summer Course
            <br/>
            2017
            <br/>
            I originally signed up for this summer course, so I can experience university life and learn as much as I can about physics and mathematics. During the time I was there, I did Quantum Physics, Chemistry and Mind Games, obtaining A*, A and B respectively at the end of the course.
            <br/>
            Oxford Summer Course
            <br/>
            2018
            <br/>
            For a second summer in a row, I applied for a summer course, even earning a scholarship, to study Physics and the Future and CSI Oxford. I ended the course with an A and an A- respectively.
            <br/>
            Queen Mary University of London
            <br/>
            2020 - 
            <br/>
            I am currently doing a Bachelor degree in Creative Computing at Queen Mary University of London. It combines coding and art, developing both the logical and mathematical abilities as well as artistic expertise.
